# Astro Website Blog Template

## Starting Point

This project was initially based on a [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoqZcxvpWzzeRwF8TEpXHtO7KYY6cNJeF
) by Chris Pennington on the [Coding in Public](https://www.youtube.com/c/codinginpublic) youtube channel.

## Continuation

After finishing the tutorial, I restyled the site using Tailwind CSS and made some additional modifications.

## Coming Soon

I have some additional updates that I need to add into the repository.  I'm planning to do this soon!

## Take a Look
